- [Task Tracker](https://github.com/nylaj726/Nyla-D-s-Project-Archive/tree/main/Task%20Tracker):
  The Interactive Task Tracker project is a simple web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks effectively. It allows users to:
  - Add tasks they want to complete.
  - Mark tasks as completed to track their progress.
  - Delete tasks once they are no longer needed.
  The app uses local storage to save tasks, ensuring that task data persists even if the page is refreshed. This makes it a lightweight, user-friendly productivity tool for personal task management.

- [Guess the Number Game](https://github.com/nylaj726/Nyla-D-s-Project-Archive/tree/main/Guess%20the%20Number%20Game):
  A simple web-based game where users guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct, and tracks the number of attempts made to 
  guess the correct number. It’s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a great introduction to basic web development concepts. [Live Server](http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html)

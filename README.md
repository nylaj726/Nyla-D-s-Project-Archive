- [Task Tracker](https://github.com/nylaj726/Nyla-D-s-Project-Archive/tree/main/Task%20Tracker):
  The Interactive Task Tracker project is a simple web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks effectively. It allows users to:
  - Add tasks they want to complete.
  - Mark tasks as completed to track their progress.
  - Delete tasks once they are no longer needed.
  The app uses local storage to save tasks, ensuring that task data persists even if the page is refreshed. This makes it a lightweight, user-friendly productivity tool for personal task management.
